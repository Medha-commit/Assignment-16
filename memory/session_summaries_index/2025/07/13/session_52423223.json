Ambiguity flags will highlight any data points that require further investigation or clarification. This will involve:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Currency Detection:</strong> Automatically detecting the currency of each price.</li>\n <li><strong>Currency Conversion:</strong> Converting all prices to a common currency using real-time exchange rates.</li>\n <li><strong>Ambiguity Flagging:</strong> Flagging any data entries that are unclear or ambiguous.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n <h3>Data Standardization Procedures</h3>\n <p><b>Data Not Available:</b> Upon data availability, data standardization procedures will be implemented to ensure consistency and comparability across different data sources. These procedures will include:</p>\n <ul>\n <li>Standardizing currency formats.</li>\n <li>Standardizing date formats.</li>\n <li>Standardizing text formats.</li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2>❓ Uncertainties & Missing Info</h2>\n<p><b>Data Not Available:</b> Currently, uncertainties and missing information cannot be assessed due to the absence of data. This section would normally identify gaps in the data and discuss their potential impact on the analysis. For example, if the availability information is missing for a significant number of books, this could bias the availability analysis. Similarly, if some book descriptions are incomplete or missing, this could affect the accuracy of the market landscape overview.</p>\n<div>\n <h3>Missing Data Imputation Techniques</h3>\n <p><b>Data Not Available:</b> Upon data availability, missing data imputation techniques will be employed to fill in the gaps in the data and improve the accuracy of the analysis. These techniques will include:</p>\n <ul>\n <li>Mean imputation.</li>\n <li>Median imputation.</li>\n <li>Regression imputation.</li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2> 🔐 Data Quality and Integrity</h2>\n<p><b>Data Not Available:</b> As no data is present, a proper data quality and integrity assessment cannot be performed. Once data is available, this section will cover data validation techniques, error detection methods, and data cleansing processes to ensure data reliability. Specific attention will be paid to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Verifying that the scraped data conforms to expected formats and ranges.</li>\n  <li><strong>Error Detection:</strong> Identifying and flagging any errors or inconsistencies in the data.</li>\n  <li><strong>Data Cleansing:</strong> Correcting or removing any erroneous or inconsistent data points.</li>\n  <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Ensuring that the data remains accurate and consistent throughout the analysis process.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n <h3>Automated Data Monitoring System</h3>\n <p><b>Data Not Available:</b> Upon data availability, an automated data monitoring system will be implemented to continuously monitor data quality and identify potential errors or inconsistencies. This system will provide real-time alerts and notifications to ensure that data quality issues are addressed promptly. The system will monitor:</p>\n <ul>\n <li>Data completeness.</li>\n <li>Data accuracy.</li>\n <li>Data consistency.</li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
